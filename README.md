# React + Mobx App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Includes:

- Latest React version 16.8.6
- Latest Mobx version 5.10.0
- Latest Babel version 7.4.3

### Getting Started

- Clone project and install dependencies.
```
> git clone https://github.com/elite0226/Bird-cage.git
> cd Bird-cage
> npm install
```

### Solved Problem

All of the previous examples are using Babel v6.0.0 but in this project, Babel v7.4.3 is being used.
The main difference between both of them is `transform-decorators-legacy` plugin in babel.
